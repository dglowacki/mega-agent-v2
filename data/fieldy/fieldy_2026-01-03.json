Okay, so I think the biggest headline from this study was that vigorous intensity physical activity was it wasn't a two to you know it wasn't twice as better than moderate intensity, right? We're talking anywhere between four times better to almost ten times better than moderate intensity exercise, which is pretty big. Um so, first of all, when it comes to all cause mortality, it seems as though one minute of vigorous intensity physical activity was equivalent to about four minutes of moderate intensity activity. So basically, in terms of reducing all cause mortality, right? So this is the death from all non-accent deposits, right? And um, if you think about that, you know, vigorous intensity physical activity is four times as potent in terms of you know, you can get the bigger bang for your buck four times as potent after reducing the risk of all cause mortality than moderate intensity physical activity. That's pretty big. Um, but it actually gets even bigger when we look at cardiovascular related mortality. And this is a really, really important point because you know, cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States, in many developed nations, including in many European nations.

We're talking anywhere between four times better to almost ten times better than moderate intensity exercise, which is pretty big. Um so, first of all, when it comes to all cause mortality, it seems as though one minute of vigorous intensity physical activity was equivalent to about four minutes of moderate intensity activity. So basically, in terms of reducing all cause mortality, right? So this is the death from all non-accent deposits, right? And um, if you think about that, you know, vigorous intensity physical activity is four times as potent in terms of you know, you can get the bigger bang for your buck four times as potent after reducing the risk of all cause mortality than moderate intensity physical activity.

Just fill into rain without a single drop on the lens? Well, if the lens spins fast enough, raindrops will only stick to it if friction gives them enough centripetal force to keep up with the circle of motion. Otherwise they're flung off, leaving you with a perfectly clear view. But you can't spin a camera lens. So instead, we use a lens attachment. That's a spinning glass disc that rotates thousands of times per minute, flinging raindrops away. But this idea isn't new. You see, ships have used giant versions of this called clear view screens for decades, letting captains see straight through storms.

And in 2025, he has been performing at a level that seems almost impossible for someone at his age. This season alone, he has broken the four-minute mile when he was only 15. He broke the 8-minute barrier for the 3,000 meters when he was only 15 years old as well.

Ruth is such an incredibly talented young prodigy that competing against the world's best is already becoming a reality. And this became abundantly clear when he made history once again at the 2025 New Zealand Secondary School Athletics Championships. Because over the course of just two days, he ran a 338 and the 1500, the equivalent of around a 355 mile. And over the course of these two days, he ran this time twice. He then ran a 146 of the 800, which again for a 16-year-old is truly ridiculous. And then in the 4x400 relay, at the very end of the competition, he threw down a 48-second split in the 400. Just the cheery on top of this already epic weekend. This two-day event was a true masterclass of middle distance excellence. And for every single race that he ran, it wasn't even close.

First, standards has cloud code skills true. This compiles your markdown standard files into clot code skills. This means instead of dumping text into the context window, the AI calls the skill tool to read the standard only when necessary. Second, use plot code subagents true.

I believe that uh but we'll give it a good context to come up with a complaint. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Um because I'm looking at it now. Because our our boards are named mission template, which is fine. Like it should be called board template, but that's totally I don't mind. But it'll be that it'll match up with the code and the mission template. So that means the live event mission and the daily mission that we uh that uh uh players play would keep on like happening simultaneously, right? Yes, and they may be uh the thing is we still we we'll want to capture",

And I I ran it the wrong test.\nOkay stage, good. Okay.\nI had a pointing at uh prod at one point and ran a test to reset the the leaderboard and it uh reset the leaderboard. So okay, that was not good. Okay.\nYeah.\nWhich test do we want to run? Uh score manager I don't need. Okay, it's the submit uh score for new player and old player. Okay, let's just do for existing player. See if I can remember this. Node test runner TS um and test score manager. Score.json and then new player test succeed. Yeah.\nThis is one of the first things that AI did really well. I remember this. This is like a year ago, and I'm like, wow, this is good guy good.",
