# Calendar Scheduling Rules

Best practices for effective calendar management and meeting scheduling.

## General Rules

### 1. Meeting Length

**Default Durations:**
- Quick sync: 15 minutes
- Standard meeting: 25 minutes (not 30)
- Extended meeting: 50 minutes (not 60)
- Deep dive: 85 minutes (not 90)
- Workshop: 2-3 hours

**Why odd lengths?**
- Provides 5-10 minute buffer between meetings
- Prevents back-to-back fatigue
- Allows time for breaks and transitions

### 2. Meeting Frequency Limits

**Daily Limits:**
- Max 4 hours of meetings per day
- Max 2 hours consecutive meetings
- At least 1 meeting-free morning or afternoon

**Weekly Limits:**
- One completely meeting-free day
- No more than 20 hours of meetings per week
- Reserve 50% of time for focused work

### 3. Optimal Meeting Times

**Best Times:**
- Tuesday-Thursday, 10:00-11:30 (mid-morning)
- Tuesday-Thursday, 14:00-15:30 (early afternoon)

**Avoid:**
- Monday before 10:00 (planning time)
- Friday after 15:00 (end-of-week fatigue)
- 12:00-13:00 (lunch time)
- Before 9:00 or after 17:00 (outside business hours)

### 4. Attendee Management

**Invite Only Necessary People:**
- Required: Must attend for meeting to proceed
- Optional: Invited for awareness, attendance not required
- FYI: Share notes after, don't invite

**Group Size:**
- Decision meetings: 3-5 people
- Brainstorming: 5-8 people
- Information sharing: any size
- Avoid: >8 people for productive discussions

## Focus Time Protection

### Block Focus Time

**Daily Focus Blocks:**
- Morning: 9:00-11:00 (deep work, complex problems)
- Afternoon: 14:00-16:00 (focused tasks, coding)

**Guidelines:**
- Mark as "busy" in calendar
- Decline meeting requests during focus time
- Schedule at least 2 hours per day
- Batch similar tasks together

### Types of Focus Time

**Deep Work (2-4 hours):**
- Complex problem-solving
- Creative work
- Strategic planning
- Writing/documentation

**Shallow Work (1-2 hours):**
- Email responses
- Administrative tasks
- Routine updates
- Quick reviews

## Meeting Preparation

### Before Scheduling

**Check:**
1. Is this meeting necessary?
2. Can it be async (email, document, Slack)?
3. Who really needs to attend?
4. What's the desired outcome?

**If Meeting is Necessary:**
1. Create clear agenda
2. Share agenda 24 hours in advance
3. Include relevant documents
4. Set clear objectives

### Agenda Template

```
Meeting: [Title]
Date: [Date/Time]
Duration: [Expected duration]

Objectives:
- [ ] Objective 1
- [ ] Objective 2

Agenda:
1. [Topic 1] (10 min) - [Owner]
2. [Topic 2] (15 min) - [Owner]
3. [Topic 3] (10 min) - [Owner]

Pre-read:
- [Document 1]
- [Document 2]

Decisions Needed:
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]
```

## Time Zone Considerations

### Distributed Teams

**Finding Overlap:**
- Identify overlapping business hours
- Rotate meeting times to share burden
- Record meetings for those who can't attend
- Use async communication when possible

**Common Overlaps:**
```
PT (Los Angeles) + ET (New York):
  - 9:00-14:00 PT = 12:00-17:00 ET ✓
  - Best: 10:00-11:00 PT = 13:00-14:00 ET

PT + CET (Paris):
  - 8:00-9:00 PT = 17:00-18:00 CET ✓
  - Best: 8:00-8:30 PT (early for PT, late for CET)

ET + IST (India):
  - 8:00-10:30 ET = 17:30-20:00 IST ✓
  - Best: 9:00-10:00 ET = 18:30-19:30 IST
```

**Fairness:**
- Rotate early/late meeting times
- Don't always pick same timezone
- Consider recording for async viewing
- Respect local working hours

## Calendar Hygiene

### Regular Maintenance

**Weekly:**
- Review next week's calendar
- Decline unnecessary meetings
- Block focus time
- Schedule prep time before important meetings

**Monthly:**
- Review recurring meetings (still needed?)
- Clean up old/canceled events
- Adjust focus time blocks
- Evaluate meeting patterns

### Event Details

**Always Include:**
- Clear, descriptive title
- Video link or location
- Agenda or objective
- Required attendees marked
- Appropriate reminders

**Title Format:**
```
Good:
- "Q1 Planning: Product Roadmap Review"
- "1:1: John & Jane - Career Development"
- "All-Hands: Company Updates & Q&A"

Bad:
- "Meeting" (too vague)
- "Sync" (no context)
- "Chat" (unprofessional)
```

## Recurring Meetings

### When to Use

**Good for Recurring:**
- Weekly team standups
- Monthly all-hands
- Quarterly planning
- Regular 1:1s

**Bad for Recurring:**
- One-time decisions
- Project kick-offs
- Ad-hoc discussions

### Management

**Quarterly Review:**
- Still providing value?
- Right frequency?
- Right attendees?
- Can be shortened?

**If Not Working:**
- Cancel or reduce frequency
- Switch to async updates
- Rotate facilitators
- Change format

## Metrics to Track

### Personal Metrics

- Total meeting hours per week
- Percentage of time in meetings
- Number of meetings declined
- Focus time hours per week

### Team Metrics

- Average meeting length
- Meeting frequency trends
- Attendee satisfaction
- Meeting cost (attendees × duration × hourly rate)

### Red Flags

- >50% of time in meetings
- <10 hours focus time per week
- Meetings regularly run over
- No agenda or objectives
- Same meetings recurring without value
